# ralloc

A fast & memory efficient userspace allocator.

This allocator is used as the default Redox.

## A note on its state.

It fully works, although it is relatively slow, since it haven't been optimized
yet.

I consider the state of the code quality very good.

## Platforms supported out-of-the-box

- [x] BSD
- [x] Linux
- [x] Mac OS X
- [x] Redox
- [ ] Windows

## Using ralloc

Add `ralloc` to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.ralloc]
git = "https://github.com/redox-os/ralloc.git"
```

then import it in your main file:

```rust
extern crate ralloc;
```

`ralloc` is now ready to roll!

Note that `ralloc` cannot coexist with another allocator, unless they're deliberately compatible.

## Features

### Thread-local allocation

Ralloc makes use of a global-local model allowing one to allocate or deallocate
without locks, synchronization, or atomic writes. This provides reasonable
performance, while preserving flexibility and ability to multithread.

### Custom out-of-memory handlers

You can set custom OOM handlers, by:

```rust
extern crate ralloc;

fn my_handler() -> ! {
    println!("Oh no. Blame the Mexicans.");
}

fn main() {
    ralloc::set_oom_handler(my_handler);
    // Do some stuff...
}
```

### Thread-specific OOM handlers.

You can override the global OOM handler for your current thread. Enable the `thread_oom` feature, and then do:

```rust
extern crate ralloc;

fn my_handler() -> ! {
    println!("Oh no. Blame the Mexicans.");
}

fn main() {
    ralloc::set_thread_oom_handler(my_handler);
    // Do some stuff...
}
```

### Partial deallocation

Many allocators limits deallocations to be allocated block, that is, you cannot
perform arithmetics or split it. `ralloc` does not have such a limitation:

```rust
extern crate ralloc;

use std::mem;

fn main() {
    // We allocate 200 bytes.
    let vec = vec![0u8; 200];
    // Cast it to a pointer.
    let ptr = vec.as_mut_ptr();

    // To avoid UB, we leak the vector.
    mem::forget(vec);

    // Now, we create two vectors, each being 100 bytes long, effectively
    // splitting the original vector in half.
    let a = Vec::from_raw_parts(ptr, 100, 100);
    let b = Vec::from_raw_parts(ptr.offset(100), 100, 100);

    // Now, the destructor of a and b is called... Without a segfault!
}
```

### Top notch security

If you are willing to trade a little performance, for extra security you can
compile `ralloc` with the `security` flag. This will, along with other things,
make frees zeroing.

In other words, an attacker cannot for example inject malicious code or data,
which can be exploited when forgetting to initialize the data you allocate.

### Code verification

Allocators are extremely security critical. If the same address is allocated to
two different callers, you risk all sorts of vulnerabilities. For this reason,
it is important that the code is reviewed and verified.

`ralloc` uses a multi-stage verification model:

1. The type checker. A significant part of the verification is done entirely
   statically, and enforced through the type checker. We make excessive use of
   Rust's safety features and especially affine types.
2. Unit testing. `ralloc` has full-coverage unit tests, even for private
   interfaces.
3. Integration testing suit. `ralloc` uses a form of generative testing, where
   tests are "expanded" through a fixed set of functions. This allows
   relatively few tests (e.g., a few hundreds of lines) to multiply and become
   even more effective.
4. Runtime checks. `ralloc` tries to avoid runtime tests, whenever it can, but
   that is not always possible. When the security gain is determined to be
   significant, and the performance loss is small, we use runtime checks (like
   checks for buffer overflows).
5. Debug assertions. `ralloc` contains numerous debug assertions, enabled in
   debug mode. These allows for very careful testing for things like double
   free, memory corruption, as well as leaks and alignment checks.
6. Manual reviewing. One or more persons reviews patches to ensure high
   security.

### Security through the type system

`ralloc` makes heavy use of Rust's type system, to make safety guarantees.
Internally, `ralloc` has a primitive named `Block`. This is fairly simple,
denoting a contiguous segment of memory, but what is interesting is how it is
checked at compile time to be unique. This is done through the affine type
system.

This is just one of many examples.

### Platform agnostic

`ralloc` is platform independent. It depends on `ralloc_shim`, a minimal
interface for platform dependent functions. An default implementation of
`ralloc_shim` is provided (supporting Mac OS, Linux, and BSD).

### Forcing inplace reallocation

Inplace reallocation can be significantly faster than memcpy'ing reallocation.
A limitation of libc is that you cannot do reallocation inplace-only (a
failable method that guarantees the absence of memcpy of the buffer).

Having a failable way to do inplace reallocation provides some interesting possibilities.

```rust
extern crate ralloc;

fn main() {
    let buf = ralloc::alloc(40, 1);
    // BRK'ing 20 bytes...
    let ptr = unsafe { ralloc::inplace_realloc(buf, 40, 45).unwrap() };

    // The buffer is now 45 bytes long!
}
```

### Safe SBRK

`ralloc` provides a `sbrk`, which can be used safely without breaking the allocator:

```rust
extern crate ralloc;

fn main() {
    // BRK'ing 20 bytes...
    let ptr = unsafe { ralloc::sbrk(20) };
}
```

### Logging

If you enable the `log` feature, you get detailed logging of the allocator, e.g.

```
|   : BRK'ing a block of size, 80, and alignment 8.            (at bookkeeper.rs:458)
|   : Pushing 0x5578dacb2000[0x0] and 0x5578dacb2050[0xffb8].  (at bookkeeper.rs:490)
|x  : Freeing 0x1[0x0].                                        (at bookkeeper.rs:409)
x|  : BRK'ing a block of size, 4, and alignment 1.             (at bookkeeper.rs:458)
x|  : Pushing 0x5578dacc2008[0x0] and 0x5578dacc200c[0xfffd].  (at bookkeeper.rs:490)
x|x : Reallocating 0x5578dacc2008[0x4] to size 8 with align 1. (at bookkeeper.rs:272)
x|x : Inplace reallocating 0x5578dacc2008[0x4] to size 8.      (at bookkeeper.rs:354)
_|x : Freeing 0x5578dacb2058[0xffb0].                          (at bookkeeper.rs:409)
_|x : Inserting block 0x5578dacb2058[0xffb0].                  (at bookkeeper.rs:635)
```

To the left, you can see the state of the block pool. `x` denotes a non-empty
block, `_` denotes an empty block, and `|` denotes the cursor.

The `a[b]` is a syntax for block on address `a` with size `b`.

### Useless alignments

Alignments doesn't have to be a power of two.

## Planned features

### Failable allocations

Often you are interested in handling OOM on a case-by-case basis. This is
especially true when dealing with very big allocation.

`ralloc` allows that:

```rust
extern crate ralloc;

fn main() {
    let buf = ralloc::try_alloc(8, 4);
    // `buf` is a Result: It is Err(()) if the allocation failed.
}
```
